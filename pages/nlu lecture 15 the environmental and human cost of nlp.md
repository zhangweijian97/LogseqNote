	- The Carbon Cost of Al
		- kinds of costs
			- 开发成本 Costs to progress
				- Research and development of new NLP models multiplies these costs by thousands, due to experimentation with model architectures, parameters, and different datasets.
			- 访问成本（模型运行在昂贵的硬件上）Costs to access
				- Many models require access to specialized hardware (many GPUs or TPUs) limiting access to the richest (Who benefits from this? How does it affect existing power imbalances?)
			- 环境成本 Costs to the environment
				- Computation requires energy, and not all of this energy is carbon-neutral. Where it is. training NLP may not be the best allocation of that energy

	- 总结
		- 训练时间和超参数选择增加了碳排放，而这在SOTA中很常见
		- 对计算资源的掌控导致强者愈强
		- 效率高的算法降低了碳排放，但是 rebound eﬀect 导致更高消耗
			- 便宜的东西，用的人更多
		- 使用已有的模型（预训练）更环保
		- deep adaptation
			- resilience 复原
			- relinquishment 放弃
			- restoration 恢复
