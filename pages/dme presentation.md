## Presentation Details
### For the presentations, we expect that
#### each team submits (only once) a single video file
##### the video should be in MP4 format, and should be at a decent resolution (at least VGA)
##### not too large—the submission form stipulates a 100Mb file size limit
#### the video should be at most 8 minutes long
#### the video should be in “normal” speed; i.e not sped up to fit time limit
the first slide of your presentation should list
##### paper title
##### team ID (from the paper assignments)
##### UUN and names of the team members no specific constraints on formatting or any other info you wish to include
#### each team member should present as part of the video.
##### We suggest splitting into contribution, background, methods, and experiments.
### upload to [presentation slides form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sAafLmkWiUWHiRCgaTTcYRf8UZzTD55LtoM4GyB39n5UQTAxVDk4WFU2WEcwUktCT1hZOUtBNEdCViQlQCN0PWcu)
### record tool recommendation
#### using Open Broadcaster Studio (OBS)
#### screen record with ffmpeg or similar command line tools
#### using Office365 (Slide Show -> Record Slide Show)
#### using Zoom or BBCollab
#### any other method of choice (e.g. Jitsi+Dropbox)
### Its entirely up to you whether you would prefer to record each members presentation individually and just concatenate/stitch them together into one video, or if you coordinate to record all members together in one go, or any other arrangement to suit.
