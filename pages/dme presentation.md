## Presentation Details
### For the presentations, we expect that
#### each team submits (only once) a single video file
##### the video should be in MP4 format, and should be at a decent resolution (at least VGA)
##### not too large—the submission form stipulates a 100Mb file size limit
#### the video should be at most 8 minutes long
#### the video should be in “normal” speed; i.e not sped up to fit time limit
#### the first slide of your presentation should list
##### paper title
##### team ID (from the paper assignments)
##### UUN and names of the team members no specific constraints on formatting or any other info you wish to include
#### each team member should present as part of the video.
##### We suggest splitting into contribution, background, methods, and experiments.
### upload to [presentation slides form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sAafLmkWiUWHiRCgaTTcYRf8UZzTD55LtoM4GyB39n5UQTAxVDk4WFU2WEcwUktCT1hZOUtBNEdCViQlQCN0PWcu)
### record tool recommendation
#### using Open Broadcaster Studio (OBS)
#### screen record with ffmpeg or similar command line tools
#### using Office365 (Slide Show -> Record Slide Show)
#### using Zoom or BBCollab
#### any other method of choice (e.g. Jitsi+Dropbox)
## Marking
### 3 parts
#### presentation,
#### performance at the Q&A session, and
#### (weighted) audience feedback

### marking criteria
#### style: fluency, coherence within team, and audience engagement
understanding: characterise the paper faithfully and in an accessible way
slide design: structure, key points, figures, and legibility
### engagement
#### indicate their choice of paper and provide **a brief 1-paragraph summary **along with **a brief list (2-3) of questions** about it, using the [Engagement (Pre) form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sAafLmkWiUWHiRCgaTTcYW0VF5r2yGtKrh0Evy9IFfZUNFlQWVk4OUpHTEZFTkFJSDM5QTNJVVBSOC4u).
#### attend the presentation of the paper (by the concomitant group) to subsequently provide feedback on that presentation using the [Engagement (Post) form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sAafLmkWiUWHiRCgaTTcYW0VF5r2yGtKrh0Evy9IFfZURjM0VlFPSjNVWThVSTZQQzRPSjFBMVE2Mi4u).
