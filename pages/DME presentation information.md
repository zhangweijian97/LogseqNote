			- Each student must first choose a different paper from what they will present, but in the same topic as their own. 在PCA里面另外找一篇感兴趣的论文
			- Prior to the session:
				- Each student will provide a brief summary of the chosen paper and also a list of questions (2-3) for the presenters of that paper. 写一个概述，两三个问题
			- After the session:
				- Each student will answer a questionnaire about the quality and relevance of the presentation with regard to their chosen paper. 给别人评分，包括质量和相关性
		- Note: Each student only needs to attend the session where their chosen paper is being presented. However, you are of course welcome to also attend other sessions!
