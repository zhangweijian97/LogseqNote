### Sparsity Problem
## - graph incompleteness scenario:
## - - an entity does not have many (or any) relationships to other entities in the graph
## - missing data scenario:
## - - the entity is new and there is not much information about it yet, or the relevant information is corrupted/lost
## Use the Multi-view Learning method to work with the past Knowledge Graph Embedding methods to solve problems. (use attributes, such as textual information)
## In 2018, there is a model using the above method (ComplE). Although there is some research in this area. It is still very new and needs more researcher to explore.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Answer the question:"What is the gap that needs to be filled?" and/or "What is the problem that needs to be solved?"
 State the problem clearly early in a paragraph.
 Limit the variables you address in stating your problem.
 Consider bordering the problem as a question.
