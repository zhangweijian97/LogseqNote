### Each team will prerecord an 8-minute presentation that needs to be shared ahead of time (instructions will be provided on the website). Each student has to speak for about 2 minutes. 每队讲8分钟，每人2分钟
### During class hours from Week 8 onwards, in each class, there will be Q&A sessions for 7-8 teams (papers).

### Those students attending a session will be expected to have watched the video presentations ahead of time. 要提前看别组视频
### The engagement component changes slightly. It will have two parts:
#### Each student must first choose a different paper from what they will present, but in the same topic as their own. 在PCA里面另外找一篇感兴趣的论文
#### Prior to the session:
##### Each student will provide a brief summary of the chosen paper and also a list of questions (2-3) for the presenters of that paper. 写一个概述，两三个问题
#### After the session:
##### Each student will answer a questionnaire about the quality and relevance of the presentation with regard to their chosen paper. 给别人评分，包括质量和相关性
### Note: Each student only needs to attend the session where their chosen paper is being presented. However, you are of course welcome to also attend other sessions!
