- Natural Language Understanding
	- input is natural language
	- output is structured information
- Natural Language Generation
	- input is some form of non-linguistic data
	- Output: A natural language description of that data
- Machine Translation
	- Both input and output are text that convey the same meaning, but written in a different language or style.
- Objective
