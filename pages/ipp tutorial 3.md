	- title
		- A Framework of Multi-view Knowledge Graph Embeddings
	- short description
		- Knowledge Graph
			- Basic element: Triple, (entity, relation, entity), with attributes

		- Knowledge Graph Embedding
			- represents entities and relations as vectors
			- useful to machine learning models
			- for tasks, like Question & Answer, Recommendation System
			- Bordes et al., 2013
				- relation based model
				- $(\boldsymbol{h}, \boldsymbol{\mathscr{l}}, \boldsymbol{t})$
				- $\boldsymbol{h} + \boldsymbol{\mathscr{l}} \approx \boldsymbol{t}$
		- Sparsity Problem
			- graph incompleteness scenario
				- an entity does not have many (or any) relationships to other entities in the graph
			- missing data scenario
				- the entity is new and there is not much information about it yet, or the relevant information is corrupted/lost
			- relation-based approaches cannot produce adequate representations
		- Multi-view framework
			- combine information not only from **relations**, but also from **textual attributes**
	- completion criteria
		- Implement and train a model that learns embedding from multiple sources.
			- for new entity, and entities with less relations
		- Test the model on a community dataset and report performance.
