### Each team will prerecord an 8-minute presentation that needs to be shared ahead of time (instructions will be provided on the website). Each student has to speak for about 2 minutes. 每队讲8分钟，每人2分钟
### During class hours from Week 8 onwards, in each class, there will be Q&A sessions for 7-8 teams (papers).

### The engagement component changes slightly. It will have two parts:
#### Each student must first choose a different paper from what they will present, but in the same topic as their own.
#### Prior to the session:
### Each student will provide a brief summary of the chosen paper and also a list of questions (2-3) for the presenters of that paper.
After the session:
### Each student will answer a questionnaire about the quality and relevance of the presentation with regard to their chosen paper.
### Note: Each student only needs to attend the session where their chosen paper is being presented. However, you are of course welcome to also attend other sessions!
